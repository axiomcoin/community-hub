# Usage
## Serve Locally
```shell
yarn dev
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080.
If that link doesn't work, double check the output of `yarn dev`. 
You might already be serving something on port 8080 and the site may be on port 8081.

## Build for Production
```shell
yarn build
```

You probably don't need to run this command, but now you know.
